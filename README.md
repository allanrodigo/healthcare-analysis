# **healthcare-analysis**

This project performs an exploratory analysis of risk factors associated with stroke using Python and libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The objective is to identify and visualize patterns in the data to better understand the main factors contributing to the occurrence of strokes.

## The analysis focuses on several key risk factors:

- Age: Investigating how age affects the probability of having a stroke.
- Hypertension: Exploring the relationship between hypertension and stroke incidence.
- Average Glucose Level: Examining the association between blood glucose levels and stroke occurrence.

By utilizing graphical visualizations and conducting statistical tests, the project assesses the significance of the relationships between these variables and strokes. The insights gained aim to contribute to preventive measures and enhance the understanding of stroke risk factors.
